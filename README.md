# Finance
In this project, I developed a program to analyze and visualize stock prices using Python. I utilized various libraries such as Pandas, Requests, Matplotlib, and yfinance to collect historical stock price data from the Yahoo Finance API and generate insightful visualizations.

The project began by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the required dependencies. I used Pandas to handle data manipulation and analysis, Requests for making HTTP requests to the API, Matplotlib for data visualization, and yfinance to retrieve stock price data.

Next, I specified the start and end dates for the data retrieval period, focusing on a timeframe from January 1, 2018, to May 12, 2023. I selected four popular stocks, namely Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL), for analysis.

Using the yfinance library, I retrieved the historical stock prices for the specified stocks within the defined timeframe. The downloaded data was then stored in a Pandas DataFrame, enabling efficient data handling and analysis.

To visualize the stock prices, I created a line plot using Matplotlib. The plot displayed the closing prices for each stock over time, with each stock represented by a different line. Additionally, I incorporated a 50-day moving average line for each stock to observe trends more clearly.

The final visualization was presented in a clear and concise manner, with a title indicating the nature of the analysis, axes labels providing information about the data, and a legend to differentiate between the stock lines.

This project showcases my ability to work with financial data, use APIs to collect data, manipulate data using Python libraries, and create informative visualizations for data analysis.
